This is an automation job for an argentinian company that tests air velocity on industrial ACs.

The program listens for new CSV files uploaded to Google Drive from their Testo device. It then finds the averages and 
copies them into a Google Sheet form, to then calculate several numbers, like deviation and total av.

Finally, it applies some aestethic changes and sends both original and new sheet through an email.
